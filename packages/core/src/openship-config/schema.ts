/**
 * `openship.json` — the native, declarative deploy config (à la vercel.json /
 * railway.toml). A repo-root file that tells Openship how to build, run, route,
 * and scale a project, covering the deploy wizard's options. It's an
 * AUTHORITATIVE OVERLAY: auto-detection runs first, then each field present here
 * overrides it (absent fields keep the detected value). It seeds the wizard and
 * is authoritative for headless deploys (auto-deploy on push, `openship deploy`).
 *
 * This is the typed shape. `parse.ts` validates/coerces raw JSON into it; the
 * published JSON Schema (for editor autocomplete) is generated from the same
 * field set. Every field maps 1:1 to an existing API option — see the docs
 * reference page for the mapping table.
